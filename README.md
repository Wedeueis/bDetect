`./ballDetection_HSV`

After execution of the program it will show it's output in three separated windows: The binary one is the mask used to filter the original image, the other two is the original source image in the natural color space and in a HSV color space. You'll have access to a control panel used to change the filter's configuration for the threshold color mask respectively to the HUE, SATURATION and VALUE of the HSV colors and its interval range.
